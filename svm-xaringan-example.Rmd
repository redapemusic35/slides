## Post Malone's *Rich and Sad*

???

You may or may not be asking yourselves "what is philosophy?" But you may likely already know what philosophy is. You may consider yourself somewhat of a philosopher already. Perhaps you know most of the points in famous philosophical debates and you can recall these, silencing your interlocutor, gaining the admiration of your friends and so on. 

Rather then debate you, or anything like that, let me tell you a story involving a previous class. Hopefully, this story will show you what you might expect in this class. 

Last semester, I created an assignment wherein students needed to critique a song, book, or some other fiction, but according to a given philosophical foundation. Like this class, it was for a intro to philosophy course so I left it fairly broad.

Anyway, someone pointed out the song *Rich and Sad* by Post Malone. I read the lyrics and then listened to it and read some other material on and to me, it almost seems like a parody of rap music. As such, I think that it will be a helpful exercise to defend this point, namely that Post Malone's *Rich and Sad* is a parody of contemporary rap music. Because this is for an intro course, there are several objectives I'd like to pursue with such an argument.

Before we get into the actual argument itself however, it will help to specify some foundational principles. One principle that we will look at is what good philosophical structure looks like. However, in doing so, we might recognize that there is no universally accepted conclusion here. Notoriously, the three individuals in the west who are largely credited with this particular field of study, each did philosophy in a very distinctive style. Plato is known for creating dialogues. These were imagined or real conversations between individuals on topics that are to this day profound subjects of thought and conversation. Perhaps some more contemporary examples of this form of dialogue includes the 19th century Jewish

While philosophy is translated from the Greek as "Love of Wisdom", often times what philosophers do is make and analyze arguments. We can think of making or analyzing arguments as a form of reasoning. Let's look at a hypothetical argument:

---

$$
\begin{split}
\text{some folks are greedy} \\\
\text{some folks are treacherous} \\\
\textbf{therefore} \\\
\text{some folks are greedy and treacherous}
\end{split}
$$

???

Something has gone wrong here. While it may be the case that some folks are greedy and others are treacherous, there is no reason to think that some are both in the context of this argument. The argument itself gives us no reason to think that some people are both greedy and treacherous. While it may be true that some are both, there is no reason given in the context of the argument to think that some are both.

???

The study of reasoning is called logic. Logicians study arguments. We might be able to understand better what went wrong by generalizing the most important features of the argument. In what follows, we will look at one tool a philosopher can use to determine the ***validity*** of an argument, whether an argument gives us any reason to accept the conclusion. If it does, then that argument is valid.

Philosophers often replace semantic features of a proposition, such as the subject (in this case folks, i.e. persons), with letters of the English alphabet, numerals, logical operators, and brackets. We will look at these further down. For now we will look somewhat at categories, another way of generalizing relevant semantic features of a proposition.

One way to understand categories, is as a generalization of a class of thing. The following is one way that logicians, or even philosophers who are not logicians, might look at the above argument:

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{for all members of a given class of things called persons} \\\
\text{at least one is greedy.} \\\
\text{for all members of a given class of things called persons} \\\
\text{at least one is treacherous.} \\\
\text{\it{therefore}}, \\\
\text{for all members of a given class of things called persons} \\\
\text{at least one is both greedy and treacherous.}
\end{array}
$$

???

This is the same argument as above, albeit with greater structural rigidity. This added structure will help to better define the subjects of our propositions, greedy and treacherous persons.

As we stated before, the above argument is wrong, it is not ***valid*** in that it does not give us any reason to accept the conclusion. Using Venn Diagrams, we can capture why. 

First, 'Class' here is being represented by labeled circles. We see that there are three classes of things. Persons who are greedy, persons who are treacherous, and persons more generally (later down we can simplify by ignoring the general class of persons).

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
library(VennDiagram)
set.seed(1)
list1 <- list("Greedy"=sample(LETTERS, 2), "Treacherous"=sample(LETTERS, 2), "Persons"=sample(LETTERS, 25))
venn1 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)
venn2 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)
venn3 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)

grid.newpage()
grid.draw(venn3)
```
???

For now however, the largest circle represents every member of the class 'persons'.

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
library(VennDiagram)
set.seed(1)
list1 <- list("Persons"=sample(LETTERS, 25))
venn1 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)
venn2 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)
venn3 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)

grid.newpage()
grid.draw(venn3)
```

???

For no particular reason, we've given an arbitrary number representing the number of members of this class is (25). In fact however, this number represents every 'person' who has or will ever, exist. So it is feasible that this number be much much higher, say $1 \text{x} 1^{100}$.

Now remember that we said that for every member of this class, at least one is greedy. In truth however, it may be the case that half of the members of this class are greedy, or even all members except for one, are greedy. It doesn't matter how many are greedy for the argument to be true, only that at least one is greedy.

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
library(VennDiagram)
set.seed(1)
list1 <- list("Greedy"=sample(LETTERS, 2), "Persons"=sample(LETTERS, 25))
venn1 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)
venn2 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)
venn3 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)

grid.newpage()
grid.draw(venn3)
```

???

The next circle denotes every member of this class who is treacherous. Once again, it doesn't matter how many, only that at least one is treacherous.

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
library(VennDiagram)
set.seed(1)
list1 <- list("Treacherous"=sample(LETTERS, 2), "Greedy"=sample(LETTERS, 2), "Persons"=sample(LETTERS, 25))
venn1 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)
venn2 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)
venn3 <- venn.diagram(list1, filename = NULL)

grid.newpage()
grid.draw(venn3)
```

???

Notice how the circles representing the class of persons who are greedy, and the class of persons who are treacherous don't overlap. If they did overlap, similarly to how both the circles representing greedy persons, and the circle representing treacherous persons are covered by the circle representing all persons. The part that did overlap, would represent the class of persons who are both greedy and treacherous. But we don't see this. Now look at the diagram below.

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}

draw.pairwise.venn(area1=3, area2=3, cross.area=1, category=c("Treacherous","Greedy"),fill=c("Red","Yellow"))

```

???

This diagram does show two persons who are greedy and two persons who are treacherous, and at least one who is both greedy and treacherous. As such, there are three total greedy persons and 3 total treacherous persons. It just so happens that one of the persons who is greedy, is also treacherous and vice versa. This is shown by the overlapping circles.

Back to our original diagram now, what it shows then, is that for every single person who has ever existed, or will exist, at least one is greedy and at least one is treacherous. ***Nowhere*** does it say however, that at least one is ***both*** greedy and treacherous, since our circle denoting greedy persons and the one denoting treacherous persons, does not overlap.

Moving on, so far we've talked about informal logic principles. We've done this with the thought that looking at this kind of literature is good for highlighting distinctions between non-propositional (statements which are neither true or false) and propositional statements (sentences that are either true or false). 

The statements which comprise our persons argument may either be true or false. It may be the case that either it is true that there are greedy persons, treacherous persons, or persons who are both. It may be the case that they are true, providing that there is at least one greedy person, or false providing that there has never been a greedy person at any point in time ever.

### A note on Fiction

???

Often times, it seems to me, that even though a work describes itself as fiction, it still attempts to defend a given argument. For instance, the movie *Cider House Rules* is like this. It stars Toby McGuire as Homer Wells, a precocious orphan who is taught how to practice medicine (without a license) by the head of the orphanage---Dr. Wilbur Larch. Dr. Larch defends his actions, including terminating pregnancies (illegally since the movie takes place in 1940's America) and teaching his unlicensed prodigy to do the same by arguing that his patients would seek sub par care elsewhere if he declined. A seminal moment in the movie depicts a young woman impregnated by her father. Although Homer had until then, been reluctant to terminate pregnancies, he acquiesces. 

Although the premises in these arguments are more implicit, it is still important that we can clarify them, and I argue formalize them, in order to subject them to the rigors of philosophical critique. The alternative, could be that we are swayed by emotion, rather than intellectual rigor. I would like students to be able to recognize the arguments they might find in fiction, and turn them into more formal arguments.^[Fictions are often very emotionally evocative. This is because they rely on what @gilm20 calls *framing effects*. Effects that are designed to evoke a given feeling. This can include using physical deformities, or the presence of minority members of a culture (the young woman in *Cider House Rules*, and her father who impregnated her are both African American). More importantly however, it appears that news reporting is also starting to rely more heavily on framing effects. [look for citations]]

Typically, arguments are made up from a sequence of declarative statements. There are statements that come earlier in the sequence. These are called premises. They are intended to support those that come later in the sequence. These are called conclusions. The final one is the conclusion. Simple structures look like the following argument whose conclusion is that ***I am mortal***:

---

$$
\text{All women are mortal} \\\
\text{I am a woman} \\\
\textit{therefore} \\\
\text{I am mortal}
$$

???

Assuming the truth of the premises, there is no doubt to its conclusion, that I am mortal. 

Once again, for the heck of it, we can view the validity of this argument using a Venn Diagram.

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}

draw.pairwise.venn(area1=3, area2=1, cross.area=1, category=c("Mortal Women","Me"),fill=c("Red","Yellow"))

```

???

As such, this argument is ***valid***, meaning that its premises support the conclusion (notice how the circle denoting myself, exists inside the circle denoting *women*?).

However, this is only on the presupposition that I am a woman. I am not a woman however, therefore this argument falls short of another measurement, ***soundness***. An argument is sound if all of its premises are true, ***and*** it is ***valid***, meaning the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the premises.

There are many symbols used in the area of philosophy that replace, i.e. simplify the concepts they represent. The Venn Diagram uses one of these, a circle. However, when it comes it the symbols we use in arguments, the Venn Diagram only represents an illustration, it does not represent arguments themselves. For this, as mentioned above, we use letters of the English alphabet, numerals, logical operators, and brackets.

For instance, looking at the ***I am mortal*** argument, we are going to replace the subject of the propositions with letters of the English alphabet. The subject in the first proposition is women. Instead we will use the English letter *P*. For the adjective that we are attributing to the subject, in this case *mortal*, we are going to use the English letter *Q*. As such, formalizing our argument, we get ***All P are Q***. Now that we've established this, the next part is easy. ***I am a P***. As such, it follows that ***I am a Q***.

---

$$
\text{All P are Q} \\\
\text{I am P} \\\
\text{therefore} \\\
\text{I am Q}
$$

???

Maybe unnecessary, maybe not, we will look at a Venn Diagram of the above argument. I take that back, there is a bit more complexity here. Further, we can see this complexity precisely because of our use of the Venn Diagram.

First consider the following below.

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}

draw.pairwise.venn(area1=3, area2=1, cross.area=1, category=c(" Women","Me"),fill=c("Red","Yellow"))

```

???

What happens when we try to formalize it by replacing the features of the propositions with sentence letters?

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}

draw.pairwise.venn(area1=3, area2=1, cross.area=1, category=c("P","Me"),fill=c("Red","Yellow"))

```

???

It quickly becomes apparent that we need another circle. We need one that represents me, one that represents women, and one that represents all things mortal.

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
grid.newpage()
draw.triple.venn(area1 = 10, area2 = 5, area3 = 1, n12 = 5, n23 = 1, n13 = 1, 
    n123 = 1, category = c("Q", "P", "Me"), lty = "blank", 
    fill = c("skyblue", "pink1", "mediumorchid"))
```

???

The above Venn suffices because it shows us that all ***P***s, are ***Q***, there is not one ***P*** that lies outside ***Q***. If this were not the case, then we might instead see something like the following.

---

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
grid.newpage()
draw.triple.venn(area1 = 10, area2 = 5, area3 = 1, n12 = 1, n23 = 1, n13 = 1, 
    n123 = 1, category = c("Q", "P", "Me"), lty = "blank", 
    fill = c("skyblue", "pink1", "mediumorchid"))
```

???

What this says, is that some ***P***s are ***Q***, at least one (which happens to be me!), the rest are something else. But this is not our argument. Okay that's it for categoricals and Venn diagrams. Let's now look at logical operators.

As I mentioned above, we can also use logical operators. While we use letters of the English alphabet to act as place holders in declarative sentences, we will use logical operators to represent *logically significant terms*.^[@nolt97, 28--29] These often represent the relationships between the declarative sentences. Although I should not be taking a short cut here, I will have to for the sake of time. I will try to come back to provide some useful edits. For now however, I will do two things in the following section. First, we are going to look at three formal argument forms; ***modus ponens***, ***modus tollens***, and ***disjunctive syllogism***s. We will look at these in the context of the song **Rich and Sad** by *Post Malone*.

The Makarios a Solitary is a place where we are destroyed, or imagine ourselves being destroyed owning to the weight we necessarily place on the value of having special relationships in our lives. Here, a good life is impossible without these relationships.

---

> . . . I am an agent, but also a plant; . . . much that I did not make goes towards making me whatever I shall be praised or blamed for being . . . that it is equally problematic to entrust one's good to friends, lovers, or country and to try to have a good life without them --- all these I take to be not just the material of tragedy, but everyday facts of lived practical reason. [@nuss01a, 5]

???

Post deserves a place here in the Makarios a Solitary because he explores entrusting his good to another and being ruined by it. In the context of his song, he imagines needing another, and being ruined due to their absence. In other words, he imagines the impossibility of a good life without a particular special relationship.

In *Rich and Sad*, Post sings about the usual subject matter for a rap song, money and women. Yet he talks about giving it all away if given the chance to rekindle a relationship. 

---

As far as I know, the typical disjunct in most rap songs is:

$$
\lnot \text{you} \lor \lnot \text{gold chains} 
$$

???

According to openai, here are some examples

---

**Prompt:** rap songs where the narrator chooses money over people or women

**ChatGpt:**

Certainly, there are several rap songs where the narrator or artist emphasizes choosing money over people or women. Here are a few examples:

1. "Money Trees" by Kendrick Lamar ft. Jay Rock:
   In this song, Kendrick Lamar raps about the allure of money and its impact on relationships, portraying situations where money takes precedence over people.

2. "All About the Benjamins" by Puff Daddy ft. The Notorious B.I.G., Lil' Kim, and The LOX:
   This song is all about pursuing wealth and material possessions, with a focus on Benjamin Franklin's image on the hundred-dollar bill.

3. "Get Money" by Junior M.A.F.I.A. ft. The Notorious B.I.G.:
   Another song that highlights the desire for money and the willingness to prioritize it over other aspects of life.

4. "Gold Digger" by Kanye West ft. Jamie Foxx:
   While the perspective in this song is more from the viewpoint of someone avoiding being with a partner for their money, it still addresses the theme of choosing money over relationships.

---

5. "Money, Power & Respect" by The LOX ft. Lil' Kim and DMX:
   This song explores the themes of wealth, power, and respect and how they can impact relationships and priorities.

6. "Rich & Famous" by Meek Mill ft. Louie V Gutta:
   Meek Mill raps about his pursuit of wealth and fame, highlighting the sacrifices and choices he's willing to make to achieve his goals.

7. "Money Longer" by Lil Uzi Vert:
   The song delves into Lil Uzi Vert's journey to success and the importance of financial stability over other considerations.

8. "No Role Modelz" by J. Cole:
   While not entirely focused on choosing money over people, J. Cole reflects on relationships and the difficulty of finding genuine connections in a world driven by materialism.

---

Please note that the themes and interpretations of these songs can vary, and the perspective on choosing money over people or women might differ based on individual listeners' interpretations. Additionally, these examples may contain explicit language or mature themes.

In English, or the common vernacular, we might say the following,

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{either I loose you or I loose the gold chains} \\\
\text{I am not giving up my gold chains} \\\
\text{I guess it was nice knowing you}
\end{array}
$$

???

We'll call this argument *gold chains*. Here, the individual is forced to choose between a relationship that he should value, or a bunch of money. This typically results in 

---

$$
\lnot \lnot \text{ gold chains} \\\
$$

???

Namely that giving up the money is not an option. As such, the clear choice is: 

---

$$
\therefore \lnot \text{ you} \\\
$$

???

What this means is that the individual opts out of the relationship. If one has to choose between a relationship and money, then the obvious choice is the money. This is called a disjunctive syllogism. Let's look at the formal version by replacing the working parts with letters of the English alphabet.

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{A} \lor \text{B} & \text{(either A or B)} \\\ 
\lnot \text{B} & \text{(it is not B)} \\\
\therefore \text{A} & \text{(therefore it is A)}
\end{array}
$$

???

The first premise is the choice between two disjuncts; relationship or gold chains. The second premise is that giving up the gold chains is not an option. The obvious conclusion then is giving up the relationship.

You might have noticed that our version is slightly different. This difference is negligible however. The only thing we've done is add negations to the formal version.

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\neg \text{A} \lor \neg \text{B} & \text{(either not A or not B)} \\\ 
\lnot \lnot \text{B} & \text{(it is not not B)} \\\
\therefore \neg \text{A} & \text{(therefore it is not A)} 
\end{array}
$$

???

Here is the formal version of ***our*** argument.

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\neg \text{you} \lor \neg \text{gold chains} & \text{(either not you or not gold chains)} \\\ 
\lnot \lnot \text{gold chains} & \text{(not gold chains is not an option)} \\\
\therefore \neg \text{you} & \text{(therefore ya gots to go)} 
\end{array}
$$

???

A disjunctive syllogism is a ***valid*** argument form. If you see an argument taking this form then, you know that the argument is ***valid***. Of course something about this whole affair may be off-putting to you. The point is, it cannot be that the argument is invalid, so it must be some other aspect of the argument. Here you might think one of the argument's premises are false. My money would be on the second premise, giving up the gold chains is an option. This is Post Malone's view. However before we continue looking at it, we are first going make some equivalency checks.

---

### Equivalence

???

There are valid argument forms and invalid argument forms. Often times, the valid argument forms are equivalent with other valid argument forms. A better way of understanding Post Malone's contribution to Hip Hop, is by looking at one of these equivalency relationships. First however, lets look at another valid argument form.

**Modus Ponens** is another valid argument form. Instead of beginning with a disjunct however, this valid argument form begins with a material conditional. Rather than *either or*, what a material conditional says, is that on the assumption that something is the case, then something else follows. 

E.g., lets look at a **modus ponens** argument defending the position that I like sweets. It begins with the material conditional, 'If I like cake, then I like sweets'. 

---

$$
\text{I like cake} \rightarrow  \text{I like sweets}
$$

--
class: middle, center

### **If** I like cake **then** I like sweets

--

**antecedent:** 'I like cake'

**consequent:** 'I like sweets'

???

*Material conditionals* are made up of an antecedent and a consequent. In our example, 'I like cake' is the antecedent while 'I like sweets' is the *consequent*. The consequent is a *consequence* of what came before, namely the antecedent. Here is the formal version:

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{A} \rightarrow \text{B} \\\
\text{A} \\\
\therefore \text{B}
\end{array}
$$

???

The second premise of a *modus ponens* argument, affirms the *antecedent*. As it turns out then, 'I do like cake'. As such, we derive our consequent, **therefore**, 'I like sweets'.

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{If I like cake, then I like sweets} \\\
\text{I do like cake} \\\
\text{Therefore I like sweets}
\end{array}
$$

???

This argument is valid. In other words, *if* the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.

A **modus tollens** is similar to a **modus ponens**. It also begins with a material conditional. The difference is however, rather than *affirming the antecedent*, **modus tollens** denies the consequent.

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{A} \rightarrow \text{B} \\\
\lnot \text{B} \\\
\therefore \lnot \text{A}
\end{array}
$$

???

We can use the cake example here:

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{If I like cake, then I like sweets} \\\
\text{I do not sweets} \\\
\text{therefore I do not like cake}
\end{array}
$$

???

If you're like me, then you are probably thinking that while I may not like cake, it is very plausible that I might like other sweets. But that would deny the first premise, that on the supposition that I like cake, then (perhaps [and only then]), I like sweets. You are perfectly free to dispute premise one, the material conditional here. But if you are determining validity, you must accept it conditionally.

Because material conditionals are equivalent to disjuncts, gold chains can be expressed in a modus tollens. This is the route Post Malone takes. First lets look at the traditional gold chains argument in its **modus tollens** form:

---

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{you} \rightarrow \lnot \text{ gold chains} & \text{(if I have you, then I can't have gold chains)} \\\
\lnot \lnot \text{ gold chains} & \text{(not gold chains is not an option)} \\\ 
\therefore \lnot \text{you} & \text{(ya gots ta go)}
\end{array}
$$

???

Post Malone turns this on its head however. This is something I need to explore in the near future. *Apparently*, a common theme in Greek tragedy is to show good people being ruined 'because of things that just happen to them' [@nuss01a, 25]. How does this ruin come about? The ruin is often a choice an individual is forced to make. The choice is typically horrific. An example of such a choice is found in Aeschylus's *Agamemnon*. Here, Agamemnon is faced with a dilemma resulting from two contradictory divine demands. Agamemnon must sacrifice his daughter, '$\lnot$ you', to appease the goddess Artemis in order to exact vengeance on behalf of Zeus, 'gold chains'. Because the material conditional, 'you $\rightarrow$ $\lnot$ gold chains' is equivalent to the disjunct 'you $\lor$ gold chains', this can also be expressed the following way: '$\lnot$ you $\lor$ $\lnot$ gold chains. Here Agamemnon chooses 'gold chains' ('$\lnot$ $\lnot$ gold chains'), sacrificing his daughter resulting in $\lnot$ you.

We can see the equivalence using a truth table:

---

```{r echo = F, message = F}
library(formattable)

df <- data.frame(c("T", "T", "F", "F"), c("F", "T", "F", "T"), c("F", "T", "T", "T"), c("F", "T", "T", "T"))

nm <- c("(you)", 
	   "(\u00AC gold chains)", 
	   "(you \u2192 \u00AC gold chains)", 
	   "(you \u2228 gold chains)")

colnames(df) <- nm

print(df)
```

???

However, it is not the choice that is reprehensible here, rather it is the ease with which Agamemnon makes the choice. In other words, Agamemnon is not ruined by his choice. 

---

> he adopted an inappropriate attitude towards his conflict, killing a human child with no more agony, no more revulsion of feeling, than if she had indeed been an animal of a different species [@nuss01a, 33]

???

Ethically speaking then, Agamemnon's downfall was the fact that he wasn't ruined by the choice.

Many rap songs are tragic in this sense, where the rapper is not ruined by the choice he or she is forced to make. In other words, '$\lnot$ you' is often chosen with ease. However, we are not often dismayed at the choices rappers are forced to make in this regard. Perhaps rappers like to parody Greek tragedies in this sense, if true, then *Rich and Sad* is a parody of other parodies.^[But this is beside the point]

It doesn't have to be however. Perhaps it *is* plausible that '$\lnot$ gold chains', is not an option for Post and therefore we're left with '$\lnot$ you'. Perhaps his significant other has already left before he made his millions. He can try drowning his sorrows with his significant wealth, but is unsuccessful in doing so. Still either way, Post chooses the path less taken in rap songs where '$\lnot$ you' leaves him with feelings of regret. I think that this is something we do not often see in rap, earning *Rich and Sad* a place in the Makarios a Solitary.

If you do read the lyrics, I would like to apologize for the explicit language and subject matter.

- Have an interactive component to your presentation (e.g. `leaflet` or a Shiny app)? You probably want Xaringan.

Plus, you can put GIFs into your presentation with Xaringan. That's nifty. Maybe students will like that.
